### Project Description
"Clash of Legends" aanu mone‚Ä¶ oru game alle, ithu *kochayammayude* Asianet serialinte drama, *adi puli* action,um *meen polikka* style fight okke onnu cherthiya oru pottan mix aanu. Ivide physics *thallu paranja* poyittundu, jeyikkanulla pradhana kaaranam? Glory, pride,um oru *choodu beefum moonu porottayum*.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sometimes the battle crashes midway because the code tries to measure ‚Äúlegendary strength‚Äù in *parotta* units‚Ä¶ but no official conversion rate between kilograms and porottas exists.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Easy fix ‚Äî appoint a *panchayat* of local tea shop uncles to finally set the ‚Äú1 kg = 3.5 porotta‚Äù standard, with free *beef curry* samples for calibration. Battles resume only after unanimous burp approval.
